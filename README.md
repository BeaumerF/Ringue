# Ringue
Throw your rotary telephone, the future is the voice over IP !

## What does it use?
  - Qt (client side)
  - Boost.Asio (server side)

## How does it work ?
First, host the server on Unix-like systems.
Then, when you'll start your clients (on Windows or Linux), you'll have only one channel with the connected users list.
Finally, you'll be able to select one of them to start a call.

## Why this project ?
As mumble did with Qt4, Ringue is a voicechat program which try do the same with Qt5 and lighter.

## To do
- [ ] Multi-call
- [ ] Server available on Windows
